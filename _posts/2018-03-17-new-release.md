Hi everyone!

Now is the time for a new __Gtk-rs__ release! As said in the title, this time we focused our efforts on gio. A lot of types were missing, but thanks to this release, we made great improvements!

Of course, this isn't all we worked on in this release. For instance, we added support for the newer libraries' version, made a few things better and fixed some others.

We hope this new release will make your usage of __Gtk-rs__ even better. Have fun !
